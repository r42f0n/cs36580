Busn   295:   Assignment   #3 
Winter   2024 
Due   at   Start   of   Class:   Apr   11th 
◦ Instructions:
•    Show   your   work.    Partial   marks   will   be   awarded   for   correct   process   even   if there   are   math   errors.   Wrong   answers   with   no   work   shown   will   receive   a   mark   of 0.
•      I strongly encourage you   to   work   with   others;   however,   you   must   submit   your   own   version   of the   assignment.    Any   word-for-word   or   near   identical   submissions
will   receive   a   mark   of 0.
◦   Further   to   that, I   request   that   you   not   post   solutions   for   others   (note:   anyone found   doing this will be violating   academic   integrity   and the   proper   protocol   will   be   followed).
•    If   capturing   the   image   of your   work,   please   make   sure   to   have   sufficient   lighting   and   clarity   of   the   images   so   that   I   will   be   able   to   read   it.      Note   this   is   not   an   issue   if you   are   typing   your   solution;   however,   the   graphs   are   generally   easier   to   draw   freehand   and   math   with   lots   of   sub/super-script   is   a   pain   in   most   programs.   Plus,   it   is   good   to   get   practice   in   for   the   midterm   exams.
◦ Note:   you   can   hand   in   a   physical   version   of the   assignment,   but   I   will   also   have   a   place   where   you   can   submit   via   Canvas   if   you   prefer   (I   know   some   people   use   tablets   for   writing   their   assignments).
1.    (15   points)   Suppose   Mr.    Beast   is   touring/putting   on   a   show   at   various   venues   across   North   America. Furthermore, assume   one   of   the   shows   will   take   place   in   Vancouver   in   May   2024. The   hypothetical   event   will   be   held   at   BC   Place   in   front   of   a   sold-out   crowd   (≈54,000   seats). Suppose   there   are   two   types   of   Mr. Beast   fans:   fanatical   Mr.   Beast   fans   and   the   average   Mr.   Beast   fans.As   the   event   is   attracting   a   large   crowd,   suppose   a   single   food   vendor   can   get   a   gov-ernment   contract   allowing   it to be the sole   seller   of quick   meals just   outside   BC   Place.   The   crowds   will   have   a   market   demand   for   meals   that   will   depend   on   the   type   of fan.   Suppose   the   demand   for   each   Fanatical   Mr.   Beast   fan   is:

The   demand   for   each   Average   Mr.   Beast   fan   is:

Given   there   are   14,000   Fanatical   Fans   and   40,000   Average   Fans,   the   demand   function   is:

Or   the   (invese)   demand   function:
Suppose   that   instead   of a   perfectly   competitive   market,   the   monopolist   providing   the quick   meals   has   a   cost   function:  
(a)    (6    marks)   Suppose   the   monopolist   can   tell   the   difference   between   the   Average   Mr.   Beast   fan   and   the   Fanatical   Mr.   Beast   fan.   Find   the   price   and   quantity   the firm would use for each type   of fan.    Hint:   the   Marginal   Cost   is   the   same   for   both   groups   (i.e.   would   be   same   as 代 写Busn 295: Assignment #3 Winter 2024C/C++
代做程序编程语言  MC   from   assignment   #2).
(b)    (2   mark)   What   is   the   profit   of   the   firm?      Does   the   firm   prefer   this   outcome   of acting   as   a   single-pricing   monopolist   when   profit   was   $6,000?
(c)    (5 marks) In the case of asingle-pricing monopolist, the firm charged PM    = $16.80   and   produced   QM      =   12,   000.    How   does   the   consumer   surplus   compare   between   the single-pricing monopolist and using price discrimination?   Use this information   to   explain   which   fan   type   would   prefer   the   single-pricing   monopolist   over   price   discrimination.
2.   We   will   examine   the   idea   of   oligopolies   in   this   problem.      The   examples   here   will   be   based   on   the   ideas   of   competition   over   quantity   for   identical   goods   (i.e.    Cournot   and   Stackelberg).
(a)    (5   points)   We   begin   with   a   3   firm   oligopoly   and   the   assumption   that   each   firm   is   using   the   minimal   efficient   scale,   i.e.    the   lowest   cost   production   method.    Let   market   demand   be   P(Q)    =   300   −   2Q   where   Q    =    q1    +   q2    +   q3   .       Assume    each   firm   has   a   cost   of   C(qi   )   =   60qi.      Find   the   best   response   function,   then   show   the   how   much   each   firm   produces   and the   profit   created   in this   situation,   i.e   find the   Nash-Cournot   Equilibrium    (hint:      use   the   short-cut   discussed   in   class   to   make   your   life   easier)   and   profits.
(b)    (4   points)   Suppose   two   of   the   firms   from   part    (a)   merge   together   with   cost   re-   maining the   same,   i.e.    Q   = q1   + q2    where   q2    is   produced   by what was   firms   2   and   3.   Show what happens to the price   and   quantity   produced.    Explain why   merging   in   this   case   does not make   sense   (hint:   how   do   profits   in   this   part   compare   with   the joint profits   of   the   two   firms   from   part   (a)?).
(c)    (4 points) How does your answer change from part   (b) if   the two firms that merged   together gained enough market power to allow them to act   like a first mover.    Show   how   quantities   and   profits   change,   i.e.   find   the   Stackelberg   Equilibrium.
3.    Consider   the   following   game   between   a   seller   and   a   buyer:

(a)    (3   points)    Given   the   full   decision   rule/strategy   set   for   the   Buyer   in   this   game   based   on   Table 1.
(b)    (2   points)    Based   on   Table 1,   does   any   player   have   a   dominant   strategy   in   the   game?   Explain   why   or   why   not.
(c)    (1   points)   What   is   the   Nash   Equilibrium   of   the   game?    Explain.
(d)    (4 points) Instead of   the game being played simultaneously, suppose the Seller acts   first   setting   a   price   (P=$9,   $8,   or   $6)   and then the   Buyer   decides the   quantity   of   goods to   purchase   (Q   = 2,   4,   6   or   8). What   is the   Nash   Equilibrium   of the   game?   Is   it   the   same   as   in   part   (c)?    Explain.
